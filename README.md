# web-caesar

This represents the second student project in LaunchCode's LC101 for module 2.

## Description:

A simple Python/Flask application, web-caeser takes in, via an html form, text and a rotational key
and encryptes the text by way of a basic rotational cipher, e.g. "a" with rotation of 1 => "b", "a" with rotation of 2
=> "c".
